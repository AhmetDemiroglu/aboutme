<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After graduating from Gazi University, Department of City and Regional Planning, I worked actively in the Real Estate Appraisal sector between 2014 and 2023. While I was working in the field as an appraiser, I prepared reports for real estate of various qualities. My openness to professional self-improvement and ability to learn quickly, I took part in high-volume jobs in a short time and moved to the control stage.</p>

<p>In the approximately 9 years that I actively worked in the appraising sector, I have been working on houses, lands, fields, shops, fuel stations, tourism facilities, farms, industrial facilities, etc. I have prepared over 10,000 reports for many properties.</p>

<p>Apart from sectoral experience I am advanced in English and I think I am advanced in computer use as well due to the department I studied at university. While I improved myself in softwares such as AutoCAD, Photoshop and ArcGIS, which I used extensively during the 4 years of my university education and 6 months in the TÜBİTAK project, I also had the opportunity to learn and reinforce the NetCAD program during my summer internships. I also actively use Microsoft Office programs Word, Excel and Power Point at an advanced level.</p>
